Key Components and Functionalities

Imports and Setup:
   Uses libraries like torch, pandas, matplotlib, and others to handle data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
   Set several hyperparameters and constants like BATCH_SIZE, CTX_LENGTH, D_MODEL, etc., that configure the model architecture and training process.

Data Handling:
   The script checks if a specific file exists and downloads it if necessary. This setup is useful for managing datasets that are central to model's training 	and evaluation.
   It reads and processes text data from a file, which appears to be used later for tokenization and input to the model.

Model Architecture:
   defined several PyTorch modules (FeedforwardNetwork, AttentionModule, MultiHeadModule, TransformerBlock, LLMModel) which are used to build a layered 	Transformer-like model.
   Each component, such as attention mechanisms and feedforward networks, is crafted to work with specific parts of the input data, applying transformations 	and learning patterns in the sequence data.

Tokenization and Embedding:
    The LLMModel class handles text preprocessing, tokenization, and embedding, converting raw text into a format suitable for the neural network.

Training and Loss Calculation:
    The model training occurs in a loop where also periodically estimate the loss on both training and validation data.
    The loss estimation function estimate_loss also generates text using the model, providing insights into how well the model is learning and generalizing.

Utility Functions:
    Functions like get_batch, display_graph, and get_LLM_model organize the code by separating data batching, visualization, and model configuration into 	manageable sections.
